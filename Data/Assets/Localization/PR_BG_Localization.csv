We have come up with a simple plan to obtain the NG+ Weapon Systems research without prejudicing our relations with New Jericho or drawing their attention to the value of the data in their possession. 

Your team will be inserted outside the operational perimeter and proceed to the objective on foot. After obtaining a copy of the data, they will steal an armored vehicle from the garrison and make their getaway in it. They will subsequently abandon and destroy the vehicle.

The viral mist is an extremely unusual phenomenon. It is in fact a highly complex aerosol, capable of moving with deliberation and transporting viral DNA and other microbes.

2) Symptoms get worse if the subject stays or returns to locations where mist is present.

We all shot it, we emptied our mags into the fragging thing!... Then it just melted... There was nothing left... I don't know what got the rest of the squad, maybe there was more of... those things, maybe it was the regular crabbies. I lost it, I ran away, never looking back.""

A few of us managed to get to this bunker and activate the emergency beacon before we were overrun by the creatures that followed us here.

PROG_FS2_TITLE,Text,,That 1996 Extravaganza,,,,,,,,
PROG_FS2_TEXT_GENERAL_0,Text,,"So... This foolproof plan comes from Oppa Alistair re-watching a 50 year old piece of pre-Collapse entertainment where the good guys defeat an alien invasion by flying a stolen alien craft into the alien mothership and uploading a computer virus into it. 

The Behemoth is the Mothership, the virus is the Virophage and the alien craft is a modified Manticore covered in Mutagen-rich biomass, the ""Masked Manticore"". ",,,,,,,,

We will deploy a strike team on the surface of the Behemoth to locally inject the Virophage at pre-identified vital points. Hopefully it will kill it and we will be able to evacuate our team.",,,,,,,,

KEY_ALISTAIRONSYNEDRION_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Synedrion, they are not the naive fools everyone thinks that they are - and that they pretend to be. They have mastered the art of ruling while appearing not to rule: pulled a colegial Octavian, so to speak. It's the compact with the AIs that allows them to do that, relying on them for all bureaucratic functions and maintaining a soft censorship via adroit public feed algorithm manipulation... Anyway, remember those Pre-Collapse cautionary tales about AIs enslaving humanity? Yeah, me too.",,,,,,,,

KEY_ALISTAIRONANU_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"The Disciples of Anu... They are the wild card. They have disguised as religious dogma human ascendancy through an alien rDNA virus.

KEY_ALISTAIRONHELENA_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Dr. Helena has spent her life working towards reviving the Ancients as our heritage, and what better way to honor our ancestors than using their WMDs. But what was that saying about doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result? A lot of us will survive, I'm sure: those of us who remain now are good at surviving. But what if the Ancients were extinguished by the post-war political chaos, rather than by the biological weapon itself? What if reducing the number of casualties will not make a difference?

It gives him some limited augmented reality functionality and  easy access to external data, but that's about it.

These are gods we are talking about, only they cleaned their roadside picnic pretty well when they left. Fortunately for us, we were able to grow without the burden of familiarity with our precursors' magic.

Where did they come from and what could have happened to them? 

These things they have left behind: the automata, the exotic materials… I suspect that is only part of their legacy. I believe they also passed on to us a terrifying fear of the unknown and the means of defeating it. It's all there: we only need to find it. ",,,,,,,,
