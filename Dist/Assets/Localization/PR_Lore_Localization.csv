TFTV_LORE_ALISTAIR_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Sometimes Alistair thought that the transformative effect of the Pandoravirus on him could not have been greater had he actually been infected with it. 

Alistair went from a youthful college-dropout influencer to a bona fide expert, all by taking the first Mist stories seriously, while the rest of the media still considered them fake news. He grasped the significance of what was happening earlier and better than anyone else. He anticipated the Third World War and its consequences, including the rise of the highly polarized and ideologically charged factions, and the demise of race, wealth, nationality and family prestige as relevant sociological factors. 

""We are mistaken about the coming Apocalypse. It's not about extinction or survival. It's about our place in the new food chain.""

The Pandoravirus also brought Alistair into contact with the child prodigy Olena Kim. They ran into each other more than a decade ago and have been inseparable ever since, to the extent that Alastair now considers himself her oppa (older brother).

The connection - if any - between Alistair and Phoenix Project remains a mystery, but it seems like he knew Randolph Symes III personally.",,,,,,,,

TFTV_LORE_OLENA_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"Olena came of age after the Pandoravirus appeared. She never talks about her past, but it's safe to say that it was not an ordinary childhood. A prodigy, she bears the imprint of a program for the gifted: an alien within her own species.",,,,,,,,

TFTV_LORE_BENNU_DESCRIPTION,Text,,"The Phoenix Project relies on a number of Limited Artificial Intelligences: task oriented, non replicating software with limited growth potential devoid of internal personality modulators, aggregated under the namespace ""Bennu"". 

Bennu runs the life support on Phoenix bases, assists with research and manufacturing processes, and provides the Director Interface and other critical information, among many other crucial background tasks. They allow the Director maximum control in both strategic and tactical decisions. 

As a data processing unit, Bennu works to present all relevant information in the most succinct, understandable and engaging manner. Like this reading here! Hope you enjoyed it!",,,,,,,,
