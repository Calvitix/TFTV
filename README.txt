Features

- A complete reworking of the Phoenix Point campaign, with new characters, story, events and reports, and integrated and rationalised in-game lore, including a revamped Oneiric Delirium from the original release. Written by and for sci-fi horror fans!
- Completely redesigned classes, focusing on sharply defined fighting roles and strong class identities, and on removing and rebalancing overpowered synergies from the vanilla classes.
- Fight the nightmarish doubles and replicas of your deceased comrades! Revenants are special Pandoran combat forms invested with the mutilated consciousness of your fallen heroes – they will hunt you relentlessly over the course of your campaign!
- Modular campaign settings, with both very easy and nightmarishly difficult settings, and more than 20 toggles that allow you to fine tune your playthrough to your liking.
- Total rework of Legacy of the Ancients; redesigned missions, automata, and ancient weapons, with unique mechanics and reworked lore integration.
- Total rework of Kaos Engines; massively expanded marketplace that will now sell you faction research, rebalanced Kaos weaponry, and mercenary soldiers with unique gear and abilities! Vehicles and modules have undergone an extensive redesign, with a focus on expanding and specialising their roles over the course of a campaign.
- All other DLCs have been rebalanced or reintegrated.
- A series of UI changes and QOL improvements - loadable soldier loadouts, helmet visibility toggles, and more! 
- A reworked final mission, with new mechanics and access to unique support troops depending on your factional alliances. 
- Void Omens! Semi-randomised modifiers to your strategic campaign, that represent humanity’s slide into a waking nightmare.
- AI fixes, a stealth overhaul, over 50 vanilla bug fixes, and many, many more features. TERROR FROM THE VOID is a true reimagining of the vanilla experience from the ground up, made by fans who love Phoenix Point.

ADVICE FOR NEW PLAYERS

We have added 2 additional difficulties: STORY MODE (super easy mode) and ETERMES (impossibly hard). We have also re-balanced the difficulties in between so that LEGEND is very hard, and ROOKIE is very easy. If you are familiar with the base game and have beaten it on any difficulty level, for a first playthrough of TFTV we recommend playing one difficulty level below that. 

If you are new to Phoenix Point then, 1) welcome!, and 2) try playing on Rookie or Veteran.

You can also make for a more personalised difficulty setting by adjusting the different options on New Game start. Please note that while some options can be adjusted at any time in the Main Screen (Mods—>TFTV—>Settings), others can only be set when starting a new game.

Please join our Discord to share and learn tactics, give feedback or submit bug-reports.

THIRD PARTY MODS AND LOCALISATIONS

TFTV is NOT COMPATIBLE with 3rd party mods; some of them will work, some won’t, sometimes it is possible to know if they do, sometimes it is not. 

If you want to ensure that your mod is going to be compatible with TFTV, you can check our source code on GitHub (link above) and/or contact us on Discord (link above) if you need any help.

Similarly, if you did a localisation for TFTV that you want to share, please also come over to our Discord and let us know about it so we can include it.
